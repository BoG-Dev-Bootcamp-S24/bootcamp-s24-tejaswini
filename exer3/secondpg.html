                <h3>My College Essay</h3>
                <text>In my hands, copy paper and tape turn into life-size skateboards, gift boxes, dolls, wallets, and flowers. 
                    Using just these materials, I would create the things that I didn’t have, such as my cousin’s scooter. Instead of 
                    being envious of his cool ride, I decided to make my own paper version and make him jealous of mine. After hours of 
                    meticulous engineering, I had constructed the perfect scooter. I resolutely scooted around the kitchen with him, using 
                    my full body weight to overcome the friction of the crumpled paper "wheels" while he sped through the kitchen on his motorized scooter.

                <h3>My College Essay Part 2</h3>
                <text>As I grew older, my love for making things only grew. I started making realistic landscapes with my colored pencils. There’s nothing 
                    more calming than feeling the smoothness of the strokes, the waxy colors blooming from the pencil tip to form beautiful works. These 
                    same vivid colors bloom on my Bharatanatyam costume as I perform my choreographies under the dazzling stage lights. When I'm dancing, 
                    I'm always creating. My hastas, facial expressions, and gestures are all my own artistry. No one else dances the way I dance.

                <h3>My College Essay Part 3</h3>
                <text>Enter my first computer science class. I learned that programming was not as easy as it looked in the movies. Felicity Smoak and Light Yagami 
                    could hack into government systems in seconds, but it took me hours to finish programming a 2-D array. However, the best part of coding is not 
                    completing the program but beginning it. In programming, there are an infinite number of ways to find the correct solution, so I can create my 
                    own path. Finally getting the right output after hours of programming is exhilarating, but it is a mere trifle compared to the thrill of a new 
                    coding challenge, the start of a new creation.

                <h3>My College Essay Part 4</h3>
                <text>Throughout my life, I’ve made many things, using many different materials and techniques. I no longer make paper inventions, but I continue my 
                    journey of creation through stories, art, dance, technology, and more. While my paper scooter remains buried in time, my dedication to creating 
                    is everlasting.
